<h3>09/14/23 - Proposal Due</h3>
Submitted proposal, discussed design with machine shop, and finished the team contract.

<h3>09/19/23 - Redesigned System</h3>
The rail system we had originally proposed was impractical, so we had to come up with new ways to turn the stove knob.
We have narrowed it down to a new design; using a linear and a rotary actuator to manipulate the knob.

<h3>09/22/23 - Finalized Design</h3>
We have finalized our design with the machine shop. We have decided to use a stepper motor, servo motor, pulley system, and a rotary encoder
to keep track of the position of the stove knob at all times, as well as allow the user to adjust the setting of the stove either manually
or remotely.

<h3>09/26/23 - Design Document work</h3>
Worked on design document, specifically the ethics and safety, power subsystem, pulley subsystem, physical design, and problem and solution.

<h3>10/02/23 - Design Review and starting PCB design</h3>
At the design document review, we were approached with an additional feature to include a timer to automatically turn the stove off.
We also began finalizing the parts we would use for the final design, and went to the machine shop and ECEB shop to gather parts.

<h3>10/06/23 - PCB Review</h3>
Attended PCB review session and got some feedback on our schematic. We realized we need to research more about our speficic components
so that we could find valid footprints to use. We also need to research the USB to UART bridge so that we can effectively send and receive
data from our microcontroller.

<h3>10/11/23 - First Round of PCB Orders</h3>
We were not able to submit the files for the first round of PCB orders, as we could not pass the audit on pcbway due to our footprints
not being completely correct. We decided to begin using easyEDA to design our schematic and layour for our PCB since it is better lined up
for the components and footprints we are trying to use. We also finished the teamwork evaluation form.

<h3>10/13/23 - Finalized Design with Machine shop</h3>
We finalized the design with the machine shop and provided them with all of the components that would be going into our mechanical design.

<h3>10/17/23 - Second Round of PCB Orders</h3>
We were unable to complete the design by the second round of orders due to issues with the stepper motor driver datasheet.

<h3>10/19/23 - Finished PCB layout</h3>
We have completed our PCB schematic and layout and have passed the audit on pcbway, we plan our ordering the PCB before the third round.
We have also finished the front-end design for our application and have started to look into communication between a back-end mySQL server
and the ESP32 microcontroller.
