<h3>09/14/23 - Initial Project Proposal Due</h3>
Completed project proposal. Discussed initial design implementations with machine shop. Ran into some issues regarding the rail system and turning the knob. Completed team contract and assigned general roles for who will be completing what part

<h3>09/19/23 - Further Redesigned System</h3>
Original rail system design was flawed due to not having a solid disengaging system. The problem was that there would be no way to for the user to turn the knob since the motors would be connected to the knob preventing manual rotation. After further discussion we came up with a new design idea which was making use of a linear and rotational actuator. 

<h3>09/22/23 - Finalized Project Design</h3>
After heading into the machine shop and having further discussion we were able to finalize the design. The primary changes we made was having two motors. One for engaging the pulley system (tensioner) and the other to drive the pulley subsystem. Additionally, we decided to use a rotary encoder to track position. 

<h3>09/26/23 - Design Document </h3>
For the past two days I have been working on the design document. My primary parts was dealing with setting up the microcontroller schematics and coming up finishing the subsystem requirement and verification tables for the subsystem. Additionally, I was responsible for the sensory and motor subsystems. This involved reading the datasheets and understanding how these sensors worked so that we can easily incorporate them into our project. 

<h3>10/02/23 - Design Review </h3>
At the design doc review I realized we needed to understand our project more in-depth. Especially when it came to power ratings and exactly what features we want to include and how these would be included. Additionally, one of the TAs brought up a great suggestion in that we should include a timing feature where if the user sets a time limit on the app the stove will manually turn off after the timer runs out. Additionally, we finalized the parts that we will be using and asked at ECEB shop for said parts. 

<h3>10/06/23 - PCB Review Session</h3>
When we attended the PCB review session we realized there was a lot more that we had to do. Understanding how to properly assign footprints really confused us as we didn’t really know if the footprints we were selecting would be valid or not. Additionally, there were some additionally components that we realized we needed. This includes a USB to UART bridge that would be used to program our microcontroller. 

<h3>10/11/23 - First Round of PCB Orders</h3>
We weren’t able to make the first round of PCB orders as we can not pass both the audit on PCBway and the DRC check. After realizing that many of the footprints we want for our parts weren’t available on KiCad, we looked towards other alternatives. We stumbled upon EasyEDA which we found easier to use and also to have a wider variety of part selections. Additionally, we completed the teamwork evaluation form. 

<h3>10/13/23 - Finalized Design with Machine shop</h3>
Continued to work on PCB design. I am in charge of the microcontroller unit but am also helping out with other systems. Additionally, we gave our parts to the machine shop and finalized our design. 

<h3>10/17/23 - Second Round of PCB Orders</h3>
Continued to work on PCB design. As a group we are really struggling with setting up the stepper motor driver and following the data sheet. Additionally, organizing the PCB and preventing silk screen crossover is really hard. We are thinking about just submitting our PCB order without trying to clean up the silk layer as that should have no impact on the PCB’s functionality

<h3>10/19/23 - PCB layout and front-end design</h3>
After passing the PCBway audit and finishing our PCB layout and schematic, we intend to order the PCB before the third round.
Additionally, we have completed the application's front-end design and begun investigating communication between the ESP32 microcontroller and a back-end mySQL server.

<h3>10/22/23 - App Design</h3>
Ordered PCB. We are expecting to receive the PCB around October 31. Meanwhile we are continuing to work on setting up the App and our backend server. Dinal and I are in charge of setting up the backend, while also working on setting up the communication between the ESP32 module and the App and vice versa via both websocket and http communication protocols. 

<h3>10/26/23 - App design cont. </h3>
We have finished the front end. Additionally, we our continuing to work on the backend and are still awaiting PCB.

<h3>10/31/23 - PCB arrival </h3>
PCB has arrived. We have started soldering the board. Since none of us have that much experience soldering it is taking sometime. Additionally, we are missing some parts that we need for the board. These should be coming within the next 2 days. Furthermore, we are continuing to work on the App and also are exploring breadboarding with the devboard. 

<h3>11/5/23 - PCB arrival </h3>
We have finished soldering PCB. Looking to test it soon.
